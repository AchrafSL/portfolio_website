Welcome to my portfolio!

Here is where I document my continuous journey through the world of tech. My goal is to share everything I learn, touching on:

*   **Data Science & AI**
*   **Big Data & Data Engineering**
*   **Software Development**
*   **And everything in between!**

If it involves data or code, I'm interested. Stay tuned!

In the meantime, feel free to check out the [About](/about) page to learn more about my background, or browse my [Portfolio](/portfolio) to see what I've been building.
