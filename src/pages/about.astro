        Hello! I'm <strong>Achraf Salimi</strong>. I am currently pursuing a <strong
          >Master’s degree in Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, and Advanced
          Applications</strong
        > at Ibn Tofail University. With a solid foundation from my Bachelor’s in
        Mathematics and Computer Science, I bridge the gap between theoretical algorithms
        and practical, scalable software solutions.

        <span class="text-[color:var(--accent)]"></span> The Journey
      </h3>
      <p>
        My path wasn't always linear. Despite having a university background in
        basic Java, I felt the need to deepen my understanding of computer
        science fundamentals. This led me to Harvard's <strong>CS50x</strong>.
        It was a rigorous introduction where I explored C (diving into memory
        management and data structures), Python, SQL, and Flask.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        For my final project, I challenged myself to build a full-featured <strong
          >Android To-Do app</strong
        > with AI assistance, a project that required me to learn Android development
        from scratch in just a few weeks. Earning that certificate was a pivotal moment
        that proved to me I could build anything I set my mind to.

        <span class="text-[color:var(--accent)]"></span> Diving Deep into Data
      </h3>
      <p>
        Realizing the transformative potential of data, I pivoted my focus
        towards Data Science. I sharpened my Python skills through the
        University of Michigan's <em>Python for Everybody</em> specialization and
        then embarked on an intensive journey with <strong>DataCamp</strong>.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        I have since completed both the <strong>Data Scientist</strong> and <strong
          >Data Analyst</strong
        > career tracks, and I have recently started the <strong
          >Data Engineer</strong
        > path. This comprehensive training has equipped me with a robust set of tools
        for data cleaning, visualization, predictive modeling, and now, data pipeline
        architecture.

        <span class="text-[color:var(--accent)]"></span> My Tech Stack
      </h3>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Today, I work comfortably across the data and development spectrum:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-outside ml-5 space-y-2">
        <li>
          <strong>Data Science & Analysis:</strong> I use <strong>Python</strong
          > (Pandas, NumPy) for manipulation and <strong>Scikit-learn</strong> for
          machine learning tasks like regression and clustering. I visualize insights
          using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Development:</strong> My roots in <strong>Java</strong> serve me
          well, and I am actively expanding into backend development with <strong
            >Spring Boot</strong
          > to build robust applications.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data Engineering:</strong> I understand the flow of data, from <strong
            >SQL</strong
          > databases to processing pipelines.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <span class="text-[color:var(--accent)]"></span> What's Next?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I am a firm believer in continuous growth. Currently, I am diving deeper
        into <strong>Data Engineering</strong> to truly master <strong
          >Big Data</strong
        >, a field that has fascinated me since my teenage years. In parallel,
        driven by my genuine passion for technology, I am strengthening my core
        development skills to become a versatile, end-to-end engineer.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4 italic text-[color:var(--color-text-muted)]">
        When I'm not coding, I'm focusing on maintaining a healthy balance, a
        lesson learned the hard way!, to ensure I can keep building and learning
        for the long haul.
